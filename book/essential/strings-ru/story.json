The other animals were afraid the lion would kill them all.\n\nThe animals told the lion, \u201cLet\u2019s make a deal. If you promise to eat only one animal each day, then one of us will come to you every day. Then you don\u2019t have to hunt and kill us.\u201d\n\nThe plan sounded well thought-out to the lion, so he agreed, but he also said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t come every day, I promise to kill all of you the next day!\u201d\n\nEach day after that, one animal went to the lion so that the lion could eat it. Then, all the other animals were safe.\n\nFinally, it was the rabbit\u2019s turn to go to the lion. The rabbit went very slowly that day, so the lion was angry when the rabbit finally arrived.\n\nThe lion angrily asked the rabbit, \u201cWhy are you late?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was hiding from another lion in the forest. That lion said he was the king, so I was afraid.\u201d\n\nThe lion told the rabbit, \u201cI am the only king here! Take me to that other lion, and I will kill him.\"\n\nThe rabbit replied, \u201cI will be happy to show you where he lives.\u201d\n\nThe rabbit led the lion to an old well in the middle of the forest. The well was very deep with water at the bottom. The rabbit told the lion, \u201cLook in there. The lion lives at the bottom.\u201d\n\nWhen the lion looked in the well, he could see his own face in-the water. He thought that was the other lion. Without waiting another moment, the lion jumped into the well to attack the other lion. He never came out.\n\nAll of the other animal in the forest were very pleased with the rabbit\u2019s clever trick."

He hoped the sun child would fall off. But she did not. So when the sun child was looking at the sky, not aware of the jackal\u2019s next plan, he jumped into a field of flowers. As a result, the child rolled off his back. The jackal ran away.\n\nBut the sun child left a mark on the jackal\u2019s back, a visible black mark. Ever since his experience with the sun child, the jackal has had a black back."

It looks ancient.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. This is called The Wealth of Adams County. It\u2019s about hidden gold in Adams County. It\u2019s more than a century old. It was published in 1870! Look, it even has the original cover on it.\u201d\n\nTom asked, \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s from my dad\u2019s friend. He is a nice gentleman, an officer in the army,\u201d answered Brad.\n\n\u201cThe gold doesn\u2019t really exist, does it?\u201d Tom asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but maybe! There are clues to it in this book. Let\u2019s find it!\u201d Looking for gold sounded like fun.\n\nThe first clue was to find a flat tree underground. \u201cIt must be in the forest,\u201d Tom said.\n\nBrad said, \u201cThe flat tree could be a board under the dirt. It could cover the gold.\u201d\n\nTom and Brad dug in the dirt all morning. The process of looking for gold made them hungry. They were ready to stop for lunch. But then Brad hit something hard. It was a board!\n\nBrad pounded on the board until it broke. There was a small hole under it. \u201cLook!\u201d He held up a gold coin.\n\nTom saw a piece of paper in the hole. \u201cBrad, there\u2019s more. It\u2019s a map to the rest of the gold!\u201d\n\nBrad smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d And they hurried to find the wealth of Adams County."

The bright sun was hot and made the river dry. There was no water available. People asked, \u201cWhen will the rain fall?\u201d\n\nThe Sky\u2019s response was, \u201cYou don\u2019t appreciate water. You waste it, and now I will never make rain again.\u201d\n\nA boy determined that this wasn\u2019t fair. He thought of a solution. He asked the Sky to race him.

You cannot beat me.\u201d But the boy knew he would win.\n\nWhen the race began, the boy ran forward. The Sky started raining on the hill. But puddles did not form there. When it rained on the hill, the water went down.\n\nThe Sky kept raining. The water flowed down into the river. When the boy reached the top of the hill, the river was full. The people began to celebrate. It was the highest level the river had ever been at before.\n\nThe Sky was angry. \u201cA boy can\u2019t beat me! I won\u2019t fill your river,\u201d it said.

Long ago, people there went from town to town to sell things like vegetables, clothes, and pigs. They had strong beliefs about honesty. They didn\u2019t like lying. One day, a man went to the section\u2019s center to sell things.\n\n\u201cI have a baby pig for sale! It won\u2019t cost much,\u201d he said. He held the animal above his head. His style was different from honest people\u2019s style. He was a master of tricking people and lying.\n\nA woman named Beth scanned his pig. He offered her the pig for one gold coin. That was a very small amount. Beth gave him the coin. He put it in his pocket. He walked ahead of Beth to get the pig.\n\nHe gave her a closed bag and said, \u201cHere\u2019s your pig.\u201d He then left very quickly.\n\nBeth looked at the bag\u2019s surface. It was moving. She opened it to let the pig out. A cat was inside! \u201cHe tricked me! That isn\u2019t proper,\u201d she said.\n\nLater, the man returned to trick more people. Beth saw him and the memory of the cat came back. She told her friends. They stopped him. But no one knew what to do next.\n\nSomeone said, \u201cWe need an independent and fair person to decide that.\u201d They went to the judge. Beth told him about the cat in the bag.\n\nThe judge asked, \u201cIs there evidence? Can you demonstrate how he did it?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook in his bag,\u201d said Beth. She opened it and let a cat out of the bag.

When I was in elementary school, I already knew about math and statistics. When I was a boy, I pretended to be a great scientist. I loved school, but my life at home was hard. My father lost his job, so my family lived in poverty. We could not pay the rent in Germany. We became immigrants and went to Italy. I finished high school and went to college in Switzerland.\n\nAfter college, I began writing about science. I did not reach success in an instant, though. At first, other scientists did not approve of my work. They thought I was a failure. Rising to the rank of an admired scientist was a gradual process. Soon, people started to notice that I was right. At last, I began to get some recognition.\n\nI showed how to find the approximate size of very big things, like stars. I also detected and explained the movement of very small things, like atoms. And for fun, I made a machine that could refrigerate food by inserting heat. I never retired. It was my duty to keep working. I overcame many hard times, and I will be remembered for my important works."

For this reason, the activity is known as \u201ctrick-or- treating.\u201d Shortly after people first began trick-or-treating, parents started sending their children to beg on that day. Housewives gave the children food if they performed a song or a dance. When people moved to America from all over the world, they brought this tradition with them.

She pulled her hair upwards every day because she didn\u2019t have a brush to make it nice. Joe wanted to fix his grandfather\u2019s watch.\n\nFor their anniversary, Stella wanted to get Joe what he wanted. But then she did the arithmetic. It would take at least six months to save enough money. Then she had an idea. She cut off all of her hair and sold it.\n\nMeanwhile, Joe knew that he could never fix his watch. So he polished it and sold it. He made enough to buy the brush.\n\nOn their anniversary, the door burst open. Joe was excited to give Stella his gift. But first, Stella gave him the money to fix the watch. When he saw his wife without any hair, he smiled. \u201c I sold my watch to buy you something,\u201d Joe said. He gave her the brush, and she laughed. They were both willing to give up something very special to make each other happy."

    "body": "The nation of Greenland isn\u2019t very green. The sun\u2019s rays don\u2019t shine there for three whole months. As a result, it\u2019s covered with snow, ice and frost. Then how was the name derived? It started with a Viking named Erik the Red. Erik had many merits. However, there was an underlying problem . . . he got angry easily. People were scared of him. However, he was married to the niece of a very powerful man. So everybody tried to be nice to him.\n\nOne day, Erik fought with his neighbor and killed him. His consequent punishment was to leave Iceland.\n\nMany stories circulated about a land west of Iceland. But only a fraction of the people in Iceland believed them. Still, Erik wanted to find it.\n\nErik sailed toward the land via the Atlantic Ocean. His marine knowledge was good, but the trip was hard. Some of his men drowned. Erik\u2019s lieutenant wanted to resign from his position. Others thought about committing suicide.\n\nSuddenly, Erik thought he saw something. \u201c I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Erik. \u201c It must be an illusion.\u201d But it was no trick\u2014it was the new land!\n\nErik trembled in the cold polar air. He saw that there was ice everywhere. He realized that the ice could keep enemies out. Not even the best navy could invade the new land. He could start a new dynasty in his name. But how could he convince people to live here?\n\n\u201c I\u2019ll call it \u2018Greenland,\u2019\u201d he said. Erik\u2019s plan worked Within two years, over a thousand people moved to Greenland. In the end, Greenland got its name all because of a trick."

Then they tried to wash it down the drain, but it got all over the floor. Later, my brothers said that I did it and I had to wipe it up.\n\nI worried that my parents liked them more than me. One autumn day, I was sure I would make my parents proud. I bought a model rocket. After I put it together, I invited everybody to watch it. I wanted my brothers to envy my technical knowledge. I lit the fuse, but nothing happened.\n\n\u201c Looks like your fireworks don\u2019t work. I hope you kept the receipt so you can return them,\u201d my brother said.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s not fireworks!\u201d I screamed. They were making fun of me again.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what went wrong. I hadn\u2019t altered anything. I quickly moved the wires on the bottom, hoping that would help. Suddenly, the rocket flew up. We stood aside as it curved through the lawn and ran straight into the mailbox. Then the mailbox collapsed. The rocket was crushed.\n\nEmbarrassed, I ran inside and hid. A few minutes later, my mom asked, \u201c Are you OK?\u201d\n\n\u201c I just wanted them to be jealous of me for once. Now I see why you and Dad don\u2019t love me as much as them,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201c That\u2019s not true!\u201d said my mom. \u201c See my fingers . . . each one is different.

The Spanish noble, Francisco Pizarro, arrived in Peru in the 1500s. He found a group of people called the Incas. The Incas believed that their leader, Atahualpa, was both a king and a god. But Pizarro didn\u2019t agree.\n\n\u201c It is a sin for a man to think he is God!\u201d he said to Atahualpa.\n\nAtahualpa thought Pizarro was insulting his heritage. He thought the blonde Spanish men held prejudices against the Incas. But Atahualpa was a kind man and didn\u2019t want to fight the Spaniards. He said, \u201c If I give you a room full of gold, will you leave my country in peace?\u201d\n\nPizarro was suspicious. He thought Atahualpa was exaggerating. But a few days later, Pizarro returned to the Inca palace with his ambassadors. He saw a room filled with stacks of gold. There were golden necklaces, cups, plates and vases. It was a great spectacle. He acknowledged that Atahualpa had told the truth. But after seeing the gold, he wanted all of Peru\u2019s gold. So he didn\u2019t leave the country.\n\nThe Spanish soldiers stayed in Peru and grabbed all the gold they could find. But the Inca people tricked the Spaniards. They mixed the gold with tin so that it was poor quality. They gave this gold to the Spaniards. Meanwhile, they hid the good gold. They stuffed it into sacks and dragged it deep into the jungle. The Spanish conquerors never found the gold. People think it is still there today."

He ran down a path beside a large canal. A wall there kept water from coming into the town during high tide. But Marcus saw a small hole in the wall. Marcus knew that if the wall broke, it would be a tragedy for the town.\n\nAt first, he hesitated. He had to choose between helping himself and helping the town. There was only one way to save the town. It seemed crazy to him, but it was the only thing he could do. He poked his finger into the hole. This didn\u2019t fix the problem forever, but it did postpone the tragedy.\n\nHis finger ached. He felt the chill of the arctic water as it splashed him. There was no one else around. He knew he had to wait until the tide descended. It was very difficult, but Marcus stayed there and saved the town.\n\nOnce the tide had descended, Marcus told everyone what happened. A group of people went to the wall. They saw the hole and fixed it. Everyone was very happy with Marcus. The local congress even gave him a gift for saving the town. He was a hero."

    "body": "Many people believe that chocolate originally came from Europe. However, chocolate, called the \u201cfood of the gods,\u201d was first made in the Americas. The first chocolate was very different from contemporary chocolate.\n\nWild chocolate trees can grow easily in the humid Amazon rain forest. Clusters of flowers growing on these trees turn to seeds. About 20 to 60 cacao beans can be found in the seeds. Cacao beans are the ingredient needed to create sweet, soothing, and delicious chocolate treats.\n\nThe Mayan and Aztec cultures both thought that chocolate trees were brought from paradise by gods. The Mayans and Aztecs used the beans from this divine tree to create a special beverage with a very pleasant odor. Surprisingly, the Aztecs believed that it would be toxic to women and children.\n\nIn the 1500s, the Spanish explorer Cortes met the Aztecs. Cortes became quite interested in the plantations where the Aztecs cultivated chocolate trees. When he returned to Europe, he took cacao beans with him. He introduced the people of Spain to the Aztecs\u2019 chocolate beverage.\n\nOver the next 100 years or so, kings, queens, and members of the upper class enjoyed drinking chocolate. They enjoyed it even more once they learned to add sugar to the beverage! Soon, chocolate had spread all across Europe. New machines allowed chocolate makers to perfect their products and produce them at a very rapid rate. Preparing the beans in special ways brought out the aroma of chocolate. The beans were combined with condensed milk to give the chocolate a smooth texture.\n\nToday, contemporary chocolates with subtle flavors fill the shelves of expensive chocolate shops. The different types of chocolate available today vary widely. True chocolate lovers can tell which is best, though. They will tell you that the flavor of high quality chocolate stays on the palate long after you finish it."

He thought, \u201cI could sell these monkeys and become very rich! I\u2019m going to take them to England.\u201d\n\nSo the admiral set traps to catch the monkeys. He put stakes in the ground, tied string around them and made loops in the string. When the monkeys ran through the forest, their feet got caught in the loops, and they couldn\u2019t escape. Then the admiral put the monkeys in cages on his ship and sailed away.\n\nThe cages were small and uncomfortable. There was no soft hay for the monkeys to sleep on. Instead, they slept on branches with sharp thorns that cut into the monkeys\u2019 flesh. For dinner, he gave them tiny pieces of sour grapefruit to eat. The monkeys grew hungry and weak.\n\nBut one day, the admiral hired a new steward. He was a kind man with a good conscience. He was horrified to see the thin monkeys in the cages. So one night he let them out.\n\nThe monkeys ran and played all over the ship! They attacked the admiral and the steward and ate their food. They completely wrecked the ship. One monkey ran into a kerosene lamp, and it fell over. The ship caught fire and began to sink! The whole crew was lost except for the monkeys.\n\nAfter the accident, the monkeys jumped onto a raft. They floated away from the fiery blaze of the ship. In the morning, they saw a little island in the distance. The monkeys used a piece of wood as a paddle, and they went toward it. They found the island shaped like an arc. They felt so happy to find a new home, and they still live there today."

The men took a ferry to Holland and met Anton. They performed a careful review of his work, and they conceded that he had made a worthwhile discovery. Anton Van Leeuwenhoek had discovered bacteria.

    "header": "HOW A SINGER HELPED WIN THE WAR",
    "body": "Sometimes famous people are vain. They only care about themselves. But Josephine Baker was an exception. In the 1930s and 1940s, Baker was one of the most famous women in France. She was a big part of the new jazz genre and culture and had a diverse group of fans. The French people especially loved her. And she loved France. So when World War II started, she wanted to help the nation that had given her so much.\n\nIn 1940, armed German troops entered Paris. When this happened, some French people formed a secret alliance. It was called the French Resistance. The group worked for the defense of France. It helped the European and American armies fight the Germans.\n\nBaker was an important member of the Resistance. She had three jobs. The first was to carry messages to and from other members. The messages were written in code on her sheets of music. The second was to provide shelter and supply goods to Resistance members. It would have been dangerous if the Germans found them.\n\nBaker\u2019s third job was the most important. Baker held concerts for European politicians and army members. She lured them in, promising an entertaining show. She enchanted them with her singing and dancing and got lots of applause. But Baker was always equipped with a small notebook at these concerts. She listened for details about the war and wrote them down. Baker sorted the details and gave authoritative reports to the Resistance.\n\nSome thought Baker\u2019s fame would be an obstacle. The Germans knew who she was, but they didn\u2019t think she was smart enough to work for the Resistance. So she could get information from the Germans easily. This helped the Resistance and the French army save lives and win the war.\n\nBaker had a big impact on the Resistance\u2019s work. She got many awards for her help. When she died, the army had a special ceremony to thank her again for her bravery."

The Sun listened as the North Wind talked with enthusiasm about how powerful he was and how he could push something from one continent to another with one breath. He said, \u201cI am the strongest thing in the sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d asked the Sun. \u201cHow do you know that you are more powerful than the stars, or the rain, or even me?\u201d\n\nThe North Wind laughed with disrespect. He yelled, \u201cYou? That\u2019s a joke!\u201d\n\nThis hurt the Sun. He was usually timid and did not want to cause conflict. Today he decided that he should teach the North Wind a lesson.\n\nIn the meantime, a man began walking along the avenue down on Earth. When the Sun looked down on the terrain below, he saw the man. He pointed down to the Earth and said, \u201cDo you see that man walking below? I bet I can get his jacket off of him. Can you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course!\u201d the North Wind replied as he took a deep breath and filled his lungs with air. He used all of his muscles in his face and belly to blow winds at his target in succession.\n\nThe harsh air currents made the man cold. The man pulled his jacket more tightly around him. It did not come off. The Sun decided to rescue the man from the mischief of the North Wind. He said, \u201cMay I try?\u201d Then he sent down sunlight that made the man warm. The man leaned against a tree. He took off his jacket and enjoyed the nice weather.\n\n\u201cYou are very powerful,\u201d the Sun said to the North Wind, \u201cbut you use violence in your bid to appear strong. You should think of an alternative. The strongest people don\u2019t use force to get what they want.\u201d"

He couldn\u2019t run fast enough to catch up to the others. He had lost the race! He shouldn\u2019t have let the nightmare affect him. He should have stayed focused on the race."

But he hit it so hard that it flew right off of the table and knocked over a glass, which shattered. The dough then crashed into the kitchen window\u2019s shutters and crumbled. Luckily, the brothers were not injured, but they did make a huge mess.\n\nA slight mistake now became a major problem. The brothers had ruined the kitchen. Just then their mother returned.

But there was no bread, and it was too late to play. They realized that trying to do something quickly often makes more work."

She matured on the streets because no one would give her a home. She had to learn how to live without eating much. She found ways to keep warm in a very cold climate. Scientists thought a tough dog like Laika would do well in a project they were putting together.\n\nIn a prior launch, Russia had put the first man-made object into space. Now, scientists wanted to see if a living thing could go to space. Although many facts about space had been learned, they weren\u2019t enough to help send humans to space safely.\n\nLaika and two other dogs were chosen to help scientists with their research. The animals were used in a variety of tests. In the end, though, only Laika would go to space. On November 3,1957 the Sputnik 2 spaceship was due to leave Earth.\n\nScientists carefully applied wires to Laika\u2019s skin to measure her body\u2019s reactions once she got into space. Laika also wore a special leash. Without it, she would float around in the spaceship. Soon after, Laika left the planet. Scientists on Earth awaited information from the ship.\n\nBut in the midst of so much excitement, something very sad happened. Scientists were able to tell that Laika was under a lot of stress. The trip confused and scared her. Laika\u2019s entire ship had become as hot as a furnace. Scientists were powerless to help the dog in her misery. After about five hours, Laika died.\n\nSome have complained that the little dog should never have been used in the mission. Scientists knew that she would not survive the trip. Laika was never buried, but a memorial has been established in Moscow. There are many songs and books about her, too. It seems that Laika became a hero to many people."

    "body": "Many scientists and intellectuals think that dinosaurs died when an asteroid smashed into the Earth millions of years ago. However, recently, there has been some controversy over this theory. Some scientists think that it isn\u2019t accurate. They think that a tiny insect may have been the biggest factor in the death of these huge creatures. That insect was the mosquito.\n\nThese scientists do think that an asteroid hit the Earth the time of the dinosaurs. But that wasn\u2019t what killed all of them. At that time, insects, including the mosquito, were beginning to evolve. Today, we can regulate the number of mosquitoes with pesticides. But that was impossible millions of years ago. The mosquitoes multiplied quickly. And they were certainly not idle. Since there were so many mosquitoes, it was easy for them to bite many of the dinosaurs. When they bit another living thing, the mosquitoes passed along a deadly disease. So the dinosaurs were stricken with the disease. A vast majority of them, from the vegetarians to the meat eaters, died.\n\nTo reinforce this idea, scientists stress how gradually the dinosaurs died. If an asteroid killed them, they would have died very quickly. But the number of dinosaurs decreased slowly. In addition, scientists have found genetic material of mosquitoes in fossils. This material proves that mosquitoes existed back then. Although there may have been other factors, the dinosaurs died mainly because of disease, the scientists say.\n\nNo matter how it happened, the dinosaurs\u2019 death had a major impact on other living things. Many dinosaurs ate mammals. After the dinosaurs died, mammals were able to evolve and produce offspring. Birds also evolved. Scientists have analyzed the genomes of birds, and they discovered that birds have identical genetic material to some dinosaurs. So there may still be dinosaurs among us after all."

He thought that this find would make him a highly esteemed celebrity at the Zoology Institute.\n\nFor the next few days, Gilbert fed and nurtured the lizard. But the lizard wasn\u2019t happy. It lost its beautiful red color and began to look ordinary. In fact, Gilbert started to wonder whether it was special at all. He went outside and found a common lizard on a piece of concrete. When he compared them, they looked exactly alike. The lizard was only red in the swamp!\n\nGilbert said to Eliza, \u201cI\u2019m going to return this lizard to the swamp. I\u2019ve learned an important lesson. Home is where we are happiest. At home, we are special like the red lizard. We can never be so happy when we are away.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Eliza. \u201cSo, can we go home now?\u201d"

I am not a technician, and the plane is out of gasoline. We\u2019ll have to find help.\u201d\n\nWilbur and Mary walked through the forest. It was difficult to find a path through the trees.

We\u2019re sure to find someone sooner or later.\u201d\n\nFor three days, the couple searched, but they found no one who could help them in their crisis. It was uncomfortable, and they were hungry without any source of nutrition. Plus, the forest was filled with dangerous beasts. Finally, Mary agreed to return to the forest people.\n\nWhen Wilbur and Mary arrived at the village, the forest people immediately welcomed them. They gave them bread made from barely to eat and a place to sleep. The next day, the forest people led Wilbur and Mary through the trees, and they promptly arrived at a small town. From there, they took a bus to the city where they found an embassy.\n\nMary was sorry that she had not trusted the forest people sooner. She learned the value of not discriminating against people who are different."

    "body": "Rainforests provide much of the world\u2019s oxygen supply. But the forests\u2019 exotic trees and animals are being killed to make room for farmers and roads. People have been trying to conserve rainforests for years. But another type of forest\u2014the cloud forest\u2014is just as beneficial to humans. Cloud forests are also in danger of disappearing, but little is being done to save them.\n\nThese forests are located at the tops of mountains, generally near the equator. These humid, wooded mountaintops are mainly in African and Central and South American countries. They are called \u201ccloud forests\u201d because their height allows for the formation of clouds among the trees.\n\nRainforests produce large amounts of oxygen. Cloud forests produce comparative amounts of water. The trees in these forests pull water out of the clouds. The moisture gathers on the leaves. When it drips, it is deposited into streams. The streams flow into towns at the bottom of the mountain. Then, it\u2019s distributed to people. The yearly cumulative rainfall in these areas is 173-198 centimeters. Cloud forests can pull in up to 60 percent of that. This water is crucial to the plants and the people in the area. It helps them survive.\n\nCloud forests are also the birthplace of countless species of plants that can\u2019t be found anywhere else. One small cloud forest has the capacity for as many types of plants as there are in all of Europe. There are so many, in fact, that scientists haven\u2019t made a comprehensive list of them yet.\n\nThese forests are being destroyed with increasing frequency. Trees are being cut down, and roads are being built in their place. Some people have an objective to get federal money to protect the forests. But they have had little success. Another strategy is to replace the destroyed plants. That, too, has been difficult because the plants are so unique. There\u2019s plenty of work to be done, but saving the cloud forests is still a possibility."

    "body": "Thucydides was the world\u2019s first historian. Presently, we get most of our knowledge about ancient Greece from his writing. But Thucydides didn\u2019t just write about history, he lived through it. However, he almost didn\u2019t survive one historical event: the Plague of Athens.\n\nIn 430 BCE, an army attacked the city of Athens, where Thucydides lived. Thousands of people hid from the army behind Athens\u2019 large walls. The city became very crowded as the population expanded. Then a horrifying disease broke out. People summoned doctors. But it was to no avail because no one understood how the disease spread. It seemed random. They didn\u2019t know that it was an organism. Instead, they defined disease as a punishment from their gods. Thucydides was incredulous that gods caused the plague, but he explained why others believed it. There was an old, long verse which predicted the disease. To paraphrase it, the verse said the gods would send a disease during a war. As a result, large crowds gathered at shrines to ask the gods to stop the plague. But the situation only worsened because these people were so close to each other they became sick. That\u2019s how they learned a fundamental lesson about the plague: it spread from person to person.\n\nPeople wanted to leave the crowded city, but they dreaded what the army outside would do to them. At this time, Thucydides got sick, too. He quickly scribbled down notes because he thought he would soon die. His writing shows a stark contrast between people\u2019s behavior before and during the plague. There were riots, and people ignored laws. They didn\u2019t think they\u2019d live long enough to be punished. Many sick people were left to die in solitude because no one wanted to be near them. The plague lingered for two years. But luckily, Thucydides survived. Without his writing, we would know much less about ancient Greece and the Plague of Athens."

    "body": "We live in a mobile society. But the cars we drive require too much gas, plus they pollute the air. Eventually, the natural resources used to make gas will run out. So what happens then? Many people think solar-powered automobiles are the answer. To learn more about this type of transportation, teams from universities and corporate organizations gather in Australia every two years for a solar car race.\n\nThe race is called the World Solar Challenge. Candidates for this tournament must design their own cars. The teams keep all their plans confidential. They don\u2019t interact with other teams because the race is very competitive. And these cars aren\u2019t just enhanced and modified versions of normal cars. They are completely different.\n\nThe cars only have room for one person and are very simple inside\u2014they don\u2019t even have a cushion for the driver to sit on. These cars are shorter and much more flat than normal cars. Most importantly, the cars incorporate solar panels onto the outside that lie parallel to each other. These panels are made from materials that take in light from the sun and turn it into electric energy. That\u2019s how they move.\n\nThese cars race over 3,000 kilometers across the Australian territories. The drivers have to heed strict guidelines. They must stop at certain intervals to charge their batteries. And unlike normal race cars, they can\u2019t go very fast. They have to drive at the normal speed limits. Although the drivers want to finish the race quickly, that is not the main goal. The objective is to see how well the cars work under normal driving conditions.\n\nBecause of the World Solar Challenge, a new era in car making and in driving is beginning. People may ridicule the solar cars because they look strange, but this is a phenomenon that isn\u2019t going away. Using the technology from the vehicles, car makers will eventually create solar cars for the rest of us."

So she decided to make gathering food for winter her primary job. Gathering food was a grueling and mundane activity, but Beth made a deliberate effort because she knew that it was important. She allotted herself a few hours every day to collect beans. By winter, she had collected a massive pile and hid them in a cache.\n\nBeth had a sister named Mary. Mary lacked ambition. She had fanciful ideas about how she would survive winter. She thought that food would just come to her and that she could work at her own convenience. She opted to spend the days playing and dancing, instead of gathering beans. When the final hours of autumn elapsed, Mary had only a paltry amount of food stored away.\n\nMary realized that her food supply was too small to last through winter. She visited her sister.

So they traveled inland, across the prairie, to the abbey.\n\nAt first only a few families arrived, seeking food and shelter. Then there was ample food. The monks fed them and let them sleep in the small cathedral.\n\nSoon, however, more families were arriving every day. These people had to travel farther, so they were in worse condition. The rugged journey had made their clothes ragged. They were cold and tired. The tiny cathedral was soon full.\n\nFood became scarce. The monks began to grumble. They began to speculate that there would be no food. \u201cIf more families come, we won\u2019t make it through the winter,\u201d said a young monk. \u201cWe must ask some of them to leave.\u201d\n\nThe abbot heard this. \u201cWe cannot do that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be wrong to deprive them of food and shelter.

While he was cleaning, he had an impulse to examine the fungus.

He thought that there might be some significance to the fungus. He immediately commenced an experiment to assess what had happened to the bacteria. It had either died by accident or the fungus had killed it. The subsequent tests proved it was the latter reason.\n\nWhat he found astonished him. The fungus actually killed the bad bacteria. All this time, he had been looking for a synthetic material to kill the bacteria. Instead, a common fungus did the job.\n\nHe knew that something in the fungus had killed the bacteria. His next step was to find those molecules that had done it. When he found them, he extracted them and put them into a pill. The drug proved to be very effective.

    "body": "Beethoven was a great composer of classical music in the 1800s. Many biographies have been written that narrate his dominance in the music world. But do you know what really makes him special? Even though millions of people got to hear his multiple masterpieces, he never did. Beethoven wrote his best pieces after he went completely deaf!\n\nHis partiality toward classical music developed when he was very young. He wasn\u2019t interested in anything else as a child. When he was five, he learned how to play the piano. From then, nothing could stop his passion for writing and playing music.\n\nWhen Beethoven was twenty, he began to lose his hearing. He got acute, spontaneous pains in his ears. His hearing kept getting worse over time. It was inevitable that he would eventually lose it altogether. It was very hard for him to keep writing music. He lost the virtue of patience, and he became notorious for his aggression. Still, he never stopped trying. His passion for music compelled him to keep performing even after he went deaf. He couldn\u2019t hear himself play, but he knew that his creations sounded gorgeous.\n\nHis final concert was held at a huge banquet. He gave the musicians a cue, and they began to play. He directed the concert with all his heart. He couldn\u2019t hear the music, but he said that he could feel it. Overall, performance was one of the finest in history. When it was over, he turned to the crowd. They clapped and cheered wildly. In that beautiful moment, the applause boosted his emotions, and he began to cry.\n\nIn 1827, he suffered from lead poisoning. He didn\u2019t survive the sickness, but his music did because great music never becomes outdated. Even though Beethoven is gone, his legacy will live on forever."

John was an undergraduate in college, and he studied anthropology and history. He knew a lot about ancient cultures.

Mark agreed to do the job, but he had a problem. He had no idea who Pharaoh Tut was! However, he thought he had the competence to build a good statue anyway. He made some crude measurements and sculpted a statue of a very old man with a tattoo on his chest. Mark was proud of his work, but when John saw the statue, he laughed aloud.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Mark asked.\n\nJohn replied, \u201cYour ignorance makes me laugh. Don\u2019t you know that Tut was only a teenager when he was pharaoh? Let me help you. I\u2019ll supervise your work. I\u2019ll give you feedback, and we\u2019ll make this a great monument.\u201d\n\nMark got another cube of stone.

For ten consecutive hours, the brothers worked. At last, the finished statue was situated in front of the museum.

He also found that he couldn\u2019t play soccer. He wouldn\u2019t be able to coordinate his actions without being able to see. Without his optic senses, he had no spatial awareness. Furthermore, he couldn\u2019t do simultaneous activities because he had to make sure he was safe first.\n\nHe sat on the lawn. Suddenly, he realized that though he couldn\u2019t see, his other senses worked perfectly fine. In fact, he began to realize new and different aspects of common objects. For example, he took a flower bud and felt it with his finger. He realized for the first time that it seemed to be covered with wax.\n\nHis hypothesis about being blind was disproved. The informative experiment had an imprint on him. It showed him sight was an asset that should be appreciated and taught him to revere the talents of blind people."

And the ship he chose was his favorite. It had an elaborate painting on the side that showed a naval battle. It also had some new updates to its computer system. His favorite ship\u2019s latest acquisition was a device with a small grid to show the ship\u2019s exact location. This new accessory kept Ernest from getting lost.\n\nAt daybreak, Ernest happily sailed the temperate waters until he was far from land. Then he saw a small boat in the distance. There was an old man standing next to its mast. He was waving his arms in the air. There was also a boy with his head hanging over the boat\u2019s edge. Ernest inferred that the boy was suffering from nausea. Both of their clothes were saturated with sea water. Ernest assumed that they were in trouble. Most people never realized, but Ernest had an innate desire to help people. He began sailing toward them, eager to facilitate their rescue and thus solve their dilemma.\n\nAs he got closer to the boat, he was shocked by its simplicity. The boat\u2019s wood looked no stronger than cardboard, and the equipment was old. Still, there were several large fish in a pouch in the boat.\n\nErnest threw a large package onto the boat.

    "body": "Scientists who study archeology say that there may be some evidence of prehistoric parachutes. But the first written history of the device comes from China about 2,100 years ago. Scientists cite an ancient book that describes parachutes. However, there is no archeological evidence that proves that an actual parachute was ever made. Later, people from northern Africa and Italy also had ideas about a similar invention. In fact, a Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s drawing corresponds closely with the modern parachute design!\n\nIn 1783, French scientist Sebastian Lenormand invented the first modern parachute. Sebastian brainstormed with other scientists to come up with a way to help people jump safely out of burning buildings. He thought the solution was to give people an object to restrict their speed while they traveled toward the ground. Many people thought that he was up to some kind of fraud, but Sebastian had a lot of integrity. His budget was limited, so he first tested his theory by using two umbrellas. He jumped out of a tree and found that the umbrellas worked.\n\nNext, he refined his invention. Rather than using umbrellas, he knit a large parachute. Finally, he jumped off a tall building on a French estate and landed safely in the courtyard.\n\nSebastian\u2019s work gave another man an idea. Jean-Pierre Blanchard had a different outlook than Sebastian. He was a hot air balloon addict. He was one of the first people to ride in a hot air balloon powered by hydrogen gas. He was a proponent of using the parachutes to exit from hot air balloons. Starting in 1785, he used his dog to show that animals could land safely from hot air balloons by using parachutes. Then, in 1793, he was faced with a chaotic experience. The hot air balloon he was riding in burst and started to fall. He was forced to use a parachute himself. And much to his relief, it saved his life!"

He often awarded the winners by setting them free or even having them join his elite army corps.\n\nThe soldier, however, decided he had seen too much violence. He now felt that all life was sacred. The night before his first match, he made a risky decision. He decided that he would not engage in combat. He knew he may never be set free, but it was a decision that he was willing to accept.\n\nIn the morning, he was led from the prisoners\u2019 compound to one of the king\u2019s arenas. A gate coated in rust stood between him and the auditorium\u2019s floor. He was worried, but he knew what he had to do.\n\nWhen the gate opened, he calmly walked to the center of the arena and sat. He started to meditate. His foe Darius, who was skilled in the realm of sword fighting and was typically not very aggressive, would not fight the quiet soldier until he attacked Darius first.\n\nDarius tried to provoke him by hacking at the air close to his head with his sword. But the soldier was not distracted. He sat quietly, as if he were dumb, and looked calmly up at the sky. Even when Darius nicked him on the cheek with the edge of his sword, the soldier did not move.\n\nAt last he threw down his sword and shield and gave up. \u201cI can\u2019t fight someone who refuses to fight me!\u201d Darius shouted to the king.\n\nThe king was very impressed with the soldier. Never in any battle had he seen someone so brave. As a result, he gave the peaceful soldier amnesty. The soldier\u2019s actions proved to the king and everyone in the arena that peace was more powerful than fighting."

They are made up of compressed electrical circuits that can detect and record data about the body.

First, a doctor must put data about the patient onto a chip. Input about the person\u2019s age, race, gender, and medical history is stored on the chip. The second phase of the process involves putting it in the person\u2019s skin. The doctor pinches a piece of skin and cuts a tiny hole with a tool shaped like a spiral. The chip is inserted, and the skin is allowed to heal. At last, it begins the task of putting data into its database.\n\nMicrochips scan the patient\u2019s body to record what is happening on the quantum level. They can find problems with the person\u2019s metabolism and organs. They can also detect viral infections. They can find the aggregate number of immune and infected cells and present the results in a ratio. They can even tell doctors what type of antibiotic to give to the patient!\n\nTo recover the chip\u2019s data, the doctor uses a special magnet that copies it. This way, the doctor can put the information from the chip onto a computer. Then they can find out exactly what is wrong with the person.\n\nThe idea of putting chips in humans is still very new. However, it is now becoming more prevalent. Scientists and doctors are hopeful about the future uses of microchips. Someday, all new babies might get a microchip soon after they are born. Doctors will be able to know about any problems from the very beginning. It is obvious that medicine and computers complement each other well."

It knew how to find food, whereas the executive did not. He refused the help of the monkey, thereby leaving himself to starve.\n\nWhen the executive was finally found, he was very skinny and sick. He had not eaten for a very longtime. Because he held a bias against the primitive ways of the monkey, he had gone hungry and almost died.

Cosmo was scared that his dreams were a preview of what was going to happen on his flight the next day.\n\nCosmo was a supernatural being who was about to turn 15 years old. In his culture, boys of his age were required to participate in an important rite. They were given wings and instructed to orbit the Earth. After successful flights, the boys officially became men. Cosmo certainly wanted to be a man, but he was scared. He went to the oracle of a god named Dano. Cosmo said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can make such a long trip. What if I get tired? What if my strength stalls, and I can\u2019t stay in the air. I\u2019ll crash and die!\u201d\n\nDano replied, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. You have all the relevant skills in your personal inventory that have been building up over the years. To ease your worry, let me tell you a little about what will happen tomorrow. You\u2019ll begin over Africa. You\u2019ll keep flying north until you come to the Himalayas. The mountaintops will look like small loaves of bread at such a high distance. The rivers of the world will look like pieces of blue string that cross the globe. Keep your body horizontal when flying against the winds of the Pacific Ocean. Keep your eyes open and enjoy the beauty of the Earth. You will be fine, you\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nCosmo replied, \u201cThanks for the overview of my journey, I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, Cosmo was provided with a divine set of wings and sent on his way. He flapped his wings and went high above the Earth. He flew over mountains, oceans, and glaciers. After a while, his inward thoughts were no longer about falling. He was actually having fun! He began to hum a song as he enjoyed the view. When he reached home, his tribe was there to greet him.\n\nThe chief said, \u201cOn behalf of the tribe, I declare you a man. We\u2019re proud of you, Cosmo!\u201d\n\nCosmo was proud of himself, too."

    "body": "In 1954, a man named Richard was dying of kidney disease. He wouldn\u2019t survive for long unless he got a new kidney right away. Richard\u2019s twin brother, Robert, was willing to donate one of his kidneys to his dying brother. At the time, however, no doctor had ever performed a successful internal organ transplant. The idea of taking an organ out of one person and putting it into another was just a fantasy. But the brothers decided to be brave and found a doctor who could make organ transplants a reality.\n\nSince Richard and Robert were twins, their heredity was identical. They had the exact same biological traits. Even their kidneys were identical on the cellular level. Therefore, Robert\u2019s working kidney could be substituted for Richard\u2019s bad one. Richard\u2019s body could adapt to the new organ if the operation was done correctly.\n\nThe twins went to Dr. Murray, who was a pioneer of new surgical methods. His dynamic team of surgeons performed the transplant. Dr. Murray made sure his surgeons followed a rigid sequence of directions so that no mistakes were made. First, they made a minimal cut in Richard\u2019s side and removed the bad kidney. Then, they made another small cut in Robert\u2019s side, removed his kidney, and transferred it into Richard\u2019s body. Finally, they sewed up the respective cuts. The entire operation only took about one hour.\n\nAfter the surgery, it was clear that both brothers were going to be OK. The operation was confirmed a success. Richard\u2019s new kidney worked great! Doctors prescribed medicine for the pain caused by the surgery. Since Richard was still weak, he used physical therapy to revive his strength. At last, Richard\u2019s transition into a healthy, happy person was complete.\n\nDr. Murray became a hero in the medical world. His success gave other doctors confidence to try organ transplants themselves. Now, doctors perform life-saving transplants and surgeries every day."

    "body": "Among the multitude of stars in the universe, there are a couple that are of great importance to people on Earth. The sun, of course, is one of them. The other is known as Polaris, the North Star. Polaris is special because it is the only star that always appears to be in the same place in the sky. Therefore, Polaris is a great compass. When people in the northern hemisphere of Earth look toward Polaris, they can be certain that they are facing north. The permanence of Polaris in the north sky has helped countless people find their destinations.\n\nBefore the invention of modern navigation tools, mariners relied on Polaris. From the top of their hulls, sailors would look for Polaris to figure out their place at sea. They figured out the angle between the star and the horizon to determine their latitude. As long as the equations weren\u2019t erroneous, the results were very reliable. Polaris also let sailors determine North, South, East, and West. By knowing directions and their location, mariners could easily navigate their ships.\n\nTo those who sail at night, volatile storms and dark clouds were more than nuisances. They could disrupt entire journeys by blocking the view of Polaris. A captain could err and make an inadvertent wrong turn. The ship could become stranded at sea, and the frantic captain would have no way to improvise to get the ship back on the right course. The mariner\u2019s fears wouldn\u2019t be soothed until the clouds cleared and Polaris came back into view. Even today, sailors sometimes opt to navigate by using Polaris on clear nights.\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to differentiate Polaris from other stars. The Big Dipper, a constellation that is well known in astrology, appears to revolve around Polaris. The handle of the Big Dipper always points to the North Star. When people get lost, it\u2019s comforting to know that their problems can be alleviated by looking at the sky."

Soon you\u2019d realize, though, that the aristocrats of Europe were very serious about their appearance.\n\nThe predominant style in women\u2019s attire was enormous dresses. They were often three times larger than the wearer. Ladies even used pads to enlarge the appearance of their hips and shoulders. On the other extreme, the aristocratic women made their waists appear extremely thin. It took several maids stretching fabric and pulling straps in order to get a lady\u2019s waist to the proper thinness. These ladies could barely breathe and often fainted.\n\nPale skin was also a craze, yet this too was done in excess. One could not simply be pale. Instead, she needed to look as if she had anemia. In order to look paler, ladies actually cut themselves daily, so they would bleed.\n\nThe hairstyles, however, were the hallmark of women\u2019s fashion. These stood a meter high on the ladies\u2019 heads. The columns of hair were a ridiculous tangle of wigs, jewels, flowers, and even stuffed birds.\n\nMen\u2019s fashion was similarly absurd. Today it would probably seem very feminine. Reputable men wore wigs of long curly hair. Their shoes had large soles or high heels so that they could walk high above the filth on the streets. Furthermore, just like the ladies, the men wore lipstick and put rouge on their cheeks.\n\nTheir clothes were brightly colored, often purple and pink. They were made from the finest of fabrics and decorated with jewels and lace. The men vied with one another to see who wore the more expensive clothes, for the clothing signified his wealth and status.\n\nBoth men and women spent huge amounts of money and time on how they looked. Though such vanity would seem vulgar today, three hundred years from now, the fashions of our time might also seem completely ridiculous."

    "body": "Once, a British gazette had an unusual story. Scientists at a zoo made a discovery about komodo dragons. Komodo dragons are giant lizards that grow up to two and a half meters long. A female lizard at the zoo had babies. However, it had never been around a male lizard in its entire life. After the scientists publicized their discovery, many people thought it was fictitious.\n\nBut it was true. It was discovered that female komodo dragons can have babies without the help of their male counterparts. This contradicts what scientists know about how most animals have babies.\n\nIn most cases, there are many things that can obstruct this type of reproduction. For example, adult males and females carry different genes needed to make an embryo. If the genes are homogeneous, the babies are weaker and have genetic problems. Over time, the weakened species dies out completely. This makes it necessary for the male to be involved. However, scientists verified that when Komodo babies are born, their genes aren\u2019t the exact same genes as their mother. Also, they are devoid of any genetic problems.\n\nScientists theorize that Komodo dragons developed the ability because it helps the species fend off extinction. If a volcano erupts, lava can kill all of the komodo dragons on an island. However, as long as one female eludes death, she can prolong the survival of the species. Luckily, Komodo dragons are vigorous swimmers. So the surviving female can plunge into the ocean and swim to another island. When she comes ashore, she can reproduce by herself. Over time, the genes within the population diverge. Then, the sparse population increases. Once again there is a surplus of lizards on one island. Scientists think that this may be how the lizards took over all of the islands in that area."

After many years, experts realized it contained a number of spells that varied greatly in scope.\n\nThe most common types of magic in the collection dealt with healing illnesses like pneumonia. Some spells also gave advice for treating people with mental illnesses, such as those who became psychotic. Some spells asked for unusual things, like crocodile dung. But botany was an important part of the magic. Many healing spells gave instructions on how to use herbs and plants that were believed to be therapeutic. For example, in order to cure arthritis, the book says that the magician should build an ornate altar. Then he should mash different types of herbs and place them on top of it. At dusk, he is supposed to say a spell, so the gods would be gratified.\n\nOther parts of the collection describe how to hone one\u2019s psychic abilities and how to give credible descriptions of the future. Often, the book advised people how to use different objects to tell the future, including tea leaves. Also, one part of the book tells what different dreams might mean.

    "header": "DANGEROUS BITES",
    "body": "There are many animals with dangerous bites in the world, but which one is the worst? Some would say that the elusive short-tailed mamushi has the worst bite. The snake only goes into homes to chase pests such as mice. Otherwise, it stays in the fields, where it\u2019s dangerous to people who forage for food there. If someone stuns it by accidentally stepping on it, it bites to protect itself. At first, the effects of the bite may seem negligible because it doesn\u2019t cause a lot of bleeding. However, after a few moments, the venom induces paralysis in the area where the individual was bitten. Furthermore, the venom can also impede respiration. If the person doesn\u2019t go to the doctor, they are susceptible to kidney deterioration.\n\nOthers would argue that tigers have the worst bite. Mother tigers are inseparable from their babies and seem to be the gentlest creatures when they are around their young. However, if the babies are threatened, the mother tiger\u2019s savage nature prevails. With strong jaws and the ability to move quickly, the tiger can kill someone with one bite. That\u2019s because it always tries to bite an important artery when it attacks. If the artery is ruptured, the victim will bleed to death.\n\nIn the mainstream, animal bites are seen as the most dangerous. But some scientists think this idea is invalid. In fact, the most dangerous bite might be the human bite. When scientists magnified the contents in human saliva, they found about three hundred different microbes in it. A human bite can be dangerous if the bacteria enters the body through a cut, which can make people very sick. Furthermore, most people don\u2019t realize how serious a man bit can be, so they don't go to the doctor right away. This gives the wound a chance to get infected and cause more problems."

He didn\u2019t remember what had happened.\n\n\u201cYou were almost killed!\u201d his wife said.\n\n\u201cYou broke several ribs. But the rest of you is still reasonably intact. You are really lucky to be alive,\u201d the doctor said.\n\nAfter five days, Randy was discharged from the hospital. The experience had taught him a poignant lesson: he was a mortal, and nature was much more powerful than him."

Many people were very envious of him.\n\nOne day, a messenger disclosed some interesting news: political unrest in Persia had weakened the empire. Before then, the Persians had taken over many countries. Many leaders were scared of the Persian conquest. But King Croesus understood the dynamics of war better than most. He decided that it would be a good time to try to beat the Persians while they were weak.\n\nHe advocated starting war, but nobody shared his sentiment. Then he asked a wise member of the senate who was visiting from Athens. The sage didn\u2019t say whether he should attack the Persians or not. He only warned him that his good luck wouldn\u2019t last.\n\nFinally, King Croesus sent a messenger to visit the Oracle, a special lady who could see % the future. The messenger gave the Oracle jugs of wine and baskets of lentils in order to make her happy.\n\nWhen the messenger came back, he was in a festive mood.\n\n\u201cWhat was the Oracle\u2019s prophecy?\u201d asked King Croesus.\n\nThe jolly messenger responded, \u201cShe said that if you attack Persia, you will destroy a great empire.\u201d\n\nThe news filled Croesus with euphoria. After hearing the Oracle\u2019s prophecy, many civilians enrolled in the Lydian army. The king marshaled his troops and prepared them for a war with Persia. Their morale was high because they were sure they would win. Soon, King Croesus authorized an attack against the Persians.\n\nHowever, the Persian army was still very strong. After a few months of fighting, it was obvious that the Oracle\u2019s prophecy had come true: by attacking the Persians, King Croesus had destroyed a great empire\u2014his own! King Croesus should have considered the advice more carefully."

Plus, the kitchen sink leaked water all over the floor. Greta was too old to do housekeeping and repairs herself, so she hired a butler named Gordon.\n\nGordon was a young, muscular man. His muscles were a testament to his strong work ethic. He believed that if he worked hard, great things would happen for him. On his first day, he worked for hours cleaning and making repairs. He swept up mounds of dirt. He tightened the valve underneath the kitchen faucet to stop the leak. He even bought timber to build new stools for the kitchen. He worked so hard that his fingers went numb, and he got cramps in his shoulders.\n\nGordon worked hard every day. Even when tasks were boring, he was never reckless. He made sure there were no flaws in his work. Gordon was worried, however, that Greta wasn\u2019t pleased. She never expressed thanks or said that he did a good job. The lack of appreciation evoked unhappy feelings in Gordon. He even thought about quitting. But he decided the right thing to do was to keep working hard.\n\nOne day, while Gordon was sweeping, Greta said, \u201cGordon! I have a surprise for you!\u201d He went to Greta\u2019s room and saw a beautiful slate statue. It looked just like him! It was adorned with a banner that read: \u201cWelcome home.\u201d\n\nGreta said, \u201cYou\u2019ve made this ugly old mansion look new again. I\u2019m so thankful for your hard work that I want you to have it. I\u2019ll move into a smaller house.\u201d\n\nHe grinned and gave Greta a big hug. He said, \u201c I\u2019m in bliss! My hard work really paid off!\u201d\n\nThe two said their farewells, and Gordon spent the afternoon admiring his beautiful new home."

    "body": "Smallpox was once the most deadly disease in the world. During the 1800s, more than 20 million people got the disease every year. Of those, nearly half died. At the onset of smallpox, people suffered from high fevers, headaches, vomiting, and aching muscles. Yet the worst symptom of all was an intolerable rash that caused irritation on the entire body. Those who survived the disease were often rendered blind or left with gross scars on their face and body.\n\nToday, however, cases of smallpox are very rare due to the work of many countries during the late 1900s. This federation of countries collaborated to completely destroy smallpox. Early in the century, wealthy countries in Europe and North America had developed a substance that made the body immune to smallpox. They had required all their citizens to get this vaccine to counteract the disease. Hence, the people of these countries no longer had to worry about smallpox.\n\nHowever, many of the needy people in poorer parts of the world still suffered from the disease. Their countries could not afford the vaccine nor supply enough doctors to curb the spread of smallpox.\n\nIn 1950, the wealthier countries of the world vowed to free the world of the disease. They pledged to supply the vaccine to any country that could not afford it. Scientists compiled lists of areas where the disease still thrived. Then doctors diagnosed people who had the disease in these areas. They enacted laws that prohibited people with smallpox from mixing with those who did not. In this way, they could not transmit the disease to others. Then the doctors gave all of them the vaccine.\n\nIt took a longtime and a lot of work. But nearly thirty years later, on December 9,1979, a group of scientists certified that smallpox had been successfully stopped. The humane efforts of people from all over the world had accomplished a great task."

    "body": "In August of 2008, a deadly cholera epidemic manifested in Zimbabwe. A severe health hazard caused the outbreak. There was an extreme lack of clean drinking water in the overcrowded urban cities. Garbage and chemicals got into the public water supplies and contaminated them. Since people did not have access to other sources, they had to drink the dirty water.\n\nThe outbreak spread rapidly and infected almost 16,000 people. The illness caused extreme pain in people\u2019s intestines. It also caused a deficiency of important fluids in sick people\u2019s bodies. Without the proper fluids and minerals, metabolic processes stopped working correctly. People were unable to digest food properly or replenish their lost nutrients. If they had not received viable treatment, they would have been likely to die. It was imperative for help to come soon.\n\nHowever, the government of Zimbabwe was unable to provide help to its people. The government didn\u2019t have a plan to stop the spread of cholera. In addition, the country was too poor to get clean water or medication for the sick. The people seemed to be doomed.\n\nLuckily, many other countries recognized the paramount need to contain the outbreak. Dozens of voluntary practitioners from Britain, France, the United States, and other countries went to Zimbabwe to treat the disease. Through the provision of sterile drinking water and medication, people finally got the treatment they badly needed. The compassionate doctors were able to save the lives of thousands. By January of 2009, the epidemic was almost completely contained.\n\nToday, the Zimbabwean government is working with other countries to prevent future epidemics. They are cleaning up the water supply and learning how to avoid health hazards. The system used to filter water is being upgraded. The government now administers the water supply plants and makes sure that they adhere to strict safety guidelines. Hopefully, future instances of cholera will be treated before they start deadly epidemics."

    "body": "If a person who lived 200 years ago was treated for a seizure today, they would be surprised by the treatment\u2019s novelty. That\u2019s because doctors in the 1800s were influenced more by primal medical beliefs than science.\n\nRather than thinking the brain caused seizures, people in the 180' still thought they were the result of strange forces. They equated seizures with the work of evil spirits. Others felt that the seizures had a cosmic or lunar cause. They believed that the cycles of the moon and constellations could make someone have a seizure.\n\nDuring a session to treat a patient who had seizures, doctors would force the patient to invoke the grace of the Almighty. They thought if the patient did this, then the patient would rid themselves of the evil spirits causing the seizures.\n\nThe advent of modern psychiatry occurred during the 1800s. At that time people who suffered from seizures were placed in psychiatric hospitals. They were treated like they were insane. However, none of the outmoded treatments worked.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the late 1850s that the causes of seizures were understood. We know today that these causes pertain to the brain. Misfired signals from the brain cause a jerking reflex in the body. These usually occur when someone is very tired.\n\nOnce the causes of seizures were known, definitive treatments were developed. Today, treatments range from taking pills to having surgery. Treatment is personalized according to the type of seizure the patient has.\n\nEven today, some people are unsure about seizures. Their most common mistake is thinking that a person having a seizure will swallow their tongue. They often shove some utensil in the person\u2019s mouth. However, this doesn\u2019t help. The utensil often blocks the airway and prevents the person from inhaling. Yet most of the public no longer fear people who have seizures. Instead, they can now help and comfort a person if they have a seizure."

He was excited because he was finally allowed to leave the hive. He left with the next swarm and was determined to find the perfect flower. Soon he saw a large, vibrant flower full of pollen. He landed on a petal and walked toward the pollen at the flower\u2019s center.\n\nImmediately, he began rolling in the pollen, gathering it on his legs and wings. The fine texture of the pollen tickled when it stuck to his body. It was the best experience the little bee had ever had. He gathered as much as he could.\n\nBut when he was flying back home, he realized that all the pollen had an adverse effect. He had no control over his flight. The intermittent wind fluctuated in power. He was blown to and fro. One minute he was flying straight, and the next minute the wind had reversed his course.\n\nHe tried to dump some of the pollen, but it acted as an adhesive. He couldn\u2019t get it off.

All of the beds, chairs, tables, and walls are cold, hard sculptures of ice.\n\nA group of architects and volunteers from all over the world traveled to the site of the Ice House and began its construction. The multicultural group journeyed through blizzards and frigid temperatures to reach the site. Once the builders arrived, there was an interchange of ideas, and tools were allocated to each worker. An expert was selected to oversee the building process to make sure there was no discord between the workers. Once a plan was generated, they got right to work. The design was very unique; the builders couldn\u2019t replicate the design from normal houses.\n\nThe first step was to build the walls and ceiling. The builders used a metal frame to help them build the structure. After the ice was in place, the frame was removed. The builders then created furniture and art pieces. Designs were carved into each piece. One worker carved big wavy lines, and another made tiny clockwise, concentric circles. Finally, the workers carved small cavities in the roof and inserted colored lights. When the work was finished, the beautiful house was ready for a resident to enjoy.\n\nLiving in the Ice House is an experience like no other. Erik stores his belongings in an ice locker and lays out a sleeping bag on his ice bed. At dinner, he dines on a delicious salad with crisp toppings. And for the main course, he enjoys appetizing fish caught from a nearby river. The fish are pierced with icicles and served on ice plates. After dinner, he gets ready for a cold night.

This number is growing every day. In just 50 years, the population will be almost 9 billion.\n\nMany people worry that the Earth won\u2019t have enough resources to support so many people. One major reason for this is that wasting resources and polluting have become habitual behaviors. Industrial output results in polluting the air with dangerous fumes. Also, cars and machines waste a ton of important natural resources like oil and water. It\u2019s possible that the Earth may become so damaged that it cannot support a large population of humans.\n\nAnother issue is the lack of useful land for cultivating crops. Even today, many people subsist on mere scraps of food and little water. In 50 years, many experts worry that huge numbers of people will starve to death. So what is being done to prepare for the future?\n\nPeople are realizing they can no longer justify their wasteful behavior or defer action to fix it. Many car companies already have patents on prototypes for very efficient cars. Such cars waste no resources and produce no pollution. A conversion to clean cars means that petroleum can be saved for the future. In addition, the environmental sectors of many governments are setting strict rules for industries that pollute too much. If companies do not abide by the standards, they are penalized with higher taxes. In some cases, their operations might be suspended altogether.\n\nFood is also an issue that is being tackled. Many countries are now subscribing to the point of view that immediate action is needed. They are determining ways to export goods to people in need, so that no one goes hungry. Experts will continue to come up with ideas for the future, and a synthesis of these ideas will help to support the growing population."

They used their farm tools and anything they could find to make their tricks more spectacular. They even twisted their bodies into crazy shapes and performed awesome jumps. Overtime, they became great acrobats, and their art form came to be known as \u201c Hundred Plays.\u201d\n\nHundred Plays involves doing many kinds of tricks. For example, in Mandarin-speaking parts of China, performers do the lion dance. They wear costumes and mimic the animal\u2019s movements. Early performers also did tricks on ropes and vines that were high above the ground.\n\nEven though the acrobats\u2019 fluid movements may have looked easy, they took a lot of work.\n\nLearning Hundred Plays is a communal event. A veteran of the acrobatic arts usually teaches younger people in the village. They spend a lot of time rehearsing. The young performers also learn an old philosophy. The teachings help them harmonize the sensory aspects of acrobatics with mental aspects. In other words, it teaches them to use their physical and mental strength together.\n\nSince the art has its origins with poor farmers, rich people used to scorn acrobats. They thought acrobats were villains. The rich people thought the acrobats just wanted to trick them. But later, their misguided opinions changed. Acrobats came to be respected in Chinese society. They were invited to perform in metropolitan areas as well as in small villages. They performed for important people, including judicial officers. Arts advocacy groups convinced the government to support Chinese acrobatics. As a result, there is now a statute that made several villages the center of training future acrobats."

She said, \u201cMichael, an evil army is involved in a conspiracy to take over Hampton. You\u2019re the only one who can defeat them and stop the tyranny. The village needs you!\u201d\n\nMichael replied, \u201c But I\u2019m too old to fight! I\u2019m not confident that I can do it.\u201d\n\nThe prophet said, \u201cYou must try. I will even make a potion to increase your strength.\u201d\n\nThe prophet took out a bottle and a funnel. She poured some vinegar and garlic into the bottle. Next, she added some seasoning and sodium and shook it up.\n\nMichael smelled the potion. \u201cWow, this is fragrant,\u201d he said in a sarcastic tone. He inverted the bottle and drank the whole potion. He immediately felt stronger. \u201c I\u2019ll try my best,\u201d he promised.\n\nMichael rode his horse to a hilltop, where he could see the village of Hampton below. He saw the evil tyrant and his men marching in a procession through the town.\n\nMichael charged down the hill and into the village. An enemy deputy officer shouted, \u201c He looks as strong as an ox!\u201d It was an apt analogy. Michael grabbed the officer and threw him across the street with one arm. The rest of the officers screamed and rode away, and their army followed.\n\nThe prophet reappeared. Michael said, \u201c It\u2019s a good thing you gave me the potion.\u201d\n\nShe replied, \u201c But Michael, the potion was fake! Your strength really came from having confidence!\n\nMichael realized he really was still great. He just needed to believe in himself."

    "header": "THE LORD AND THE FARMERS",
    "body": "A wealthy lord was renovating his mansion. He had added another story to his home with large windows that overlooked the farmers\u2019 pastures on the eastern border of his land. Around the mansion, he then erected a great wall. He built an arch for the gate out of huge slabs of stone. The lord was overjoyed with the addition to his home.\n\nHowever, one day while he was sitting on the terrace, some farmers knocked at his door. He invited them in. Despite his hospitality, the farmers appeared to be in a foul mood.\n\n\u201cWhy are you so upset?\u201d the lord asked.\n\nOne farmer replied, \u201cThat is actually the reason for our visit.\u201d He then handed the lord a petition. It alleged that the shadow cast by the mansion was harming their pastures. \u201cYour mansion now casts a shadow over several hectares of our land,\u201d the farmer explained. \u201cThe turf in the shadow has died, and our cattle now have less grass to eat.\u201d\n\n\u201c It is too late for me to revise my plans,\u201d the lord answered. \u201cYou will just have to live with the change.\u201d\n\nHis reply only heightened the farmers\u2019 anger. They left, but they assembled that night outside the mansion\u2019s gate. They planned to destroy the mansion. The lord\u2019s servants tried to defend the house, but the farmers outnumbered them.\n\nThe servants fled, and the farmers rushed into the mansion and set it on fire. Everyone got out of the house, and there were no casualties. However, the fire soon spread from the house to the adjoining pastures that belonged to the farmers.\n\nBoth sides\u2019 properties were destroyed. The lord and the farmers were sorry for their actions. The lord promised to pay for the burned pastures, and the farmers promised to rebuild the mansion. They had learned that when you fight, both sides lose."

    "header": "THE SHORTCUT",
    "body": "A truck driver was driving cargo from the outback to the coast. His load was comprised of many types of ore. He needed a huge truck to carry its bulk to a ship waiting at a pier on the country\u2019s eastern coast. At the border between two counties, he\u2019d have to pay a tariff on the cargo. However, he could keep his money if he avoided the station at the border. He worried about getting in trouble for not paying the tariff, but the thought of extra money outweighed this concern.\n\nHe took out his road map. To his surprise, it depicted a small road that had a dual advantage. It not only avoided the border station but also was a shorter route to the coast. He decided to take the shortcut.\n\nHowever, along his journey, he soon ran into problems. First, he had to cross a small wooden bridge. His truck weighed too much for the bridge. It was analogous to an elephant trying to stand on a tree branch. The bridge started to break as the truck crossed, and the trailer tilted to the right. Fortunately, the truck made it safely across, but most of the ore fell into the river below.\n\nNext, it was a very hot day. The thermometer read over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The truck\u2019s engine became too hot, so the driver parked it in the shade of a grove of trees until it cooled down.\n\nLater, he took a wrong turn. He stopped and took out his binoculars. He scanned his surroundings and eventually discovered a landmark that led him back to the proper route.\n\nFinally, he arrived at the pier, but the ship wasn\u2019t there. When he asked about the ship\u2019s whereabouts, a man said that it had left thirty minutes ago. He had not fulfilled his duty. He realized then the paradox of the shortcut. The shortest route can be the longest, and vice versa, a long route may be the fastest."

    "header": "THE MAD HATTER",
    "body": "One morning, Lucas sat outside with his grandfather. They looked past the gravel road that led to a natural reservoir on the delta. On the other side of the water, there was a cottage.\n\n\u201c Does a ghost live there?\u201d Lucas asked.\n\n\u201c No, a mad hatter lives there,\u201d said his grandfather. Lucas didn\u2019t know what a mad hatter was, but the image of a scary man haunted him.\n\nLater, Lucas went for a walk in the forest. He collected pieces of amber and granite that he found on the ground. He looked at the moss on the trees and watched a bird peck at the ground. But the forest was like a maze. Soon, Lucas was lost.\n\nLucas heard somebody behind him. He wanted to run away, but he fell. He had a streak of blood on his shirt and some pebbles stuck in his skin. Then a man appeared.\n\n\u201c I will take you home. First, let\u2019s get you cleaned up,\u201d he said.\n\nLucas followed him. When they arrived at the cottage, he realized the man was the mad hatter!\n\nHe sat down inside. It smelled like charcoal, but it looked like a normal house. The man brought Lucas back some medicine.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s a bit old, but it\u2019s not expired,\u201d the man said.\n\nWhile Lucas cleaned his cut, the man washed the blood out of his shirt with detergent.\n\nLucas asked, \u201cAre you a mad hatter?\u201d\n\nThe man laughed and replied, \u201cThat\u2019s a euphemism for a crazy person. Actually, I\u2019m pretty normal. I\u2019m a columnist fora newspaper,\u201d said the man. He pointed to his credentials which hung on the wall.\n\nLucas could hear the crickets outside. It was getting dark, so he asked, \u201cCould you take me home now?\u201d\n\nThe man said yes. Lucas was surprised that people thought the man was crazy. He was actually very courteous. Maybe Lucas should have a more liberal attitude. Next time, Lucas wouldn\u2019t make judgments about people without getting to know them first."
